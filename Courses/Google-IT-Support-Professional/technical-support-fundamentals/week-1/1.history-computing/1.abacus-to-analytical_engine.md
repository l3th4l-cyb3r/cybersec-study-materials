# From Abacus to Analytical Engine

## Word Meanings
- Computer = A device that stores and processes data by performing calculations ^b84016
	- Before we had actual computers, the term 'Computer' was used to refer to someone who actually did the calculation.
- Algorithm = A series of steps that solve specific problems

## Abacus 
- One of the earliest known computers
- Invented in 500 BC to count large numbers

## First Major Step
- Invention of Mechanical Calculator - 17th Century - Blaise Pascal
- Used a series of gears and levers - Perform calculations for the user automatically
- Limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division - small numbers
- paved the way for more complex machine 
- fundamental operations were lated applied to textile industry

### The Programmable Loom
- 1800s - Joseph Jacquard - programmable loom
- Spun up a design pattern on the fabric
- known as punch cards
#### How these worked
- There were cards that had holes in them. If loom encountered hole, it would hook thread underneath it, if it didn't, it would move on

## Charles Babbage
- gifted enginner
-  developed a series of machines 
	- greatest breakthrough to modern computer
### Difference Engine 
 - sophisticated version of the mechanical calculators
	- performed only fairly complicated mathematical
### Analytical Engine
- inspired by Jacquard's use of punch cards to perform calculations instead of manual
- Babbage used punch cards to allow people to predefine a series of calculations they wanted to perform
- very advanced mechanical calculator

#### Ada Lovelace
- 1st one to realize the true potential of the engine
- Engine could be used for more than just pure calculations
- Coded 1st algorithm for the engine
	- 1st example of computer programming
