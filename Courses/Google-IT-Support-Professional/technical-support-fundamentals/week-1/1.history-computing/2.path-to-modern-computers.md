# The Path to Modern Computers

# Word Meanings
Cryptography - The art of writing and solving codes
Compiler - they make it possible to translate human language via a programming language into machine code
Open Source - anyone could modify the code and share it
- The development of computing has been steadily growing since the invention of Analytical Engine.
	- But it didn't make a huge leap forward until WW2
- Research into computing was very expensive
	- Electronic components were large - lots of them to compute anything of value
- Computers took up too much space
	- Many effors were underfunded --> unable to make headway
- When WW2 broke out, governments started pouring money and resources into computing research
	- Wanted to develop technologies that would give them advantages over other countries
	- advancements were made in fields like cryptography
- During the war, computers were used to process secret messages from enemies faster than a human could ever do 
- today, cryptography plays a role in secure communication
	- Cryptography --> critical part of cyber security

# How Computers started to make dramatic impact on society
- Alan Turing --> English Mathematician and Computer Scientist
	- Key part of team that cracked the Enigma Machine
	- Enigma Machine was a German Military Invention

- After WW2, companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, etc. advanced their technologies into the academic, business and government realms. 
	- These orgs. invented new methods to store data in computers which fueled the growth of computational power.

- A magnetic tape worked by magnetizing data onto a tape. 
	- In the 1970s and 80s, peope used to listen to music on vinyl records or casette tapes.

- Early computers took up a lot of space.
- There were huge machines to read data and racks of vacuum tubes to help move that data
- Vacuum tubes control the electricity voltages and all sorts of electronic equipment like televisions and radios. 
	- These vacuum tubes took up a lot of space

- ENIAC was one of the earliest forms of general purpose computers
- Wall-to-Wall convulution of massive electronic components and wires
- 17000 vacuum tubes, 1800 square feet of floor space

- Eventually the industry started using transistors to control electricity voltages
- It's now a fundamental component of all electronic devices
- Transistors perform the same func. as vacuum tubes but they are more compact and efficient. ^8d922a
- We can easily have billions of transistors in a small computer chip today

- 1st compiler was invented by Admiral Grace Hopper
- Takeaway: Huge milestone to Computer Programming
- now, Learning programming languages is accessible for almost anyone anywhere
- We no longer have to learn how to write machine code in 1s and 0s.

- Eventually, the industry gave way to first hard disk drives and microprocessors
- Programming languages started becoming the predominant way for engineers to develop computer software
- Computers were getting smaller and smaller
	- They were getting small enough to fit on tabletops
- Xerox Alto was the first computerthat resembled the computers we're familiar with right now
- First computer to implement a GUI that used icons, a mouse and a window
- Earlier computers had so expensive costs that they were inaffordable for average families to afford
	- They were usually found in military and university research facilities
- When companies like Xerox started building machines at a relatively affordable price and at a smaller form factor, the consumer age of computing began
- In the 1970s, a young engineer named Steve Wozniak invented the Apple I, a single-board computer meant for hobbyists
- With his friend Steve Jobs, they created a company called Apple Computer
- Follow up to Apple I -> Apple II, was ready for the average consumer to use 
- Apple II was phenomenal success, selling for nearly 2 decades and giving a new generation of people access to comuters
- For 1st time, computers became affordable for middle class and helped bring computing technology into both home and offices
- In the 1980s, IBM introduced it's personal computer.
- Released with a primitive version of an operating system --> MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)
SIDE NOTE: Modern OSs don't have just text anymore, they have beautiful icons, words and images like what we see on our smartphones 
- IBM's PC was widely adopted and made more accessible to consumers, thanks to partnership with Microsoft
- Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates, eventually created Microsoft Windows
- MS Windows --> preferred OS in the workplace and dominated the computing industry because it could be run on any compatible hardware
- As the dependence on IT rose, so did the demand for skilled workers who could support that technology 
- A new type of computing was emerging: Video Games
- During the 1970s and 80s, a coin-operated entertainment machine called arcades became more and more popular
- company known as Atari developed one of the 1st coin-operated arcade game in 1972 called Pong
- Pong became such a sensation that people were standing in lines at bars and rec centers for hours at a time to play
- Games like Pong launched the video game era
- Atari went on to launch the video computer system which helped bring personal video consoles into homes
- Video games have contributed to the evolution of computers in a very real way, so we can't dismiss them as simple computer/video toys
- Video games show people that computers don't always have to be all work and no play, they are actually a great source of entertainment too
- This was a huge milestone for the computing industry as at that time computers were primarily used in the workplace or at research institutions
- Huge companies like Apple Macintosh and MS-Windows taking over the OS space
- Richard Stallman was a programmer who started developing a free Unix-Like Operating System
- Unix was an OS developed by --> Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
- Unix --> wasn't cheap and wasn't available to everyone
- Stallman created --> GNU
- GNU --> free to use with similar functionality to Unix
- Unlike MS-Windows and Macintosh, GNU's code --> Open-Source
- GNU --> didn't evolve into a full OS
	- But it set the foundation for formation of the largest Open-Source OS, Linux
- Linux --> Linux Torvalds
- Linux --> Major Player in Today's Operating Systems
- By the early 90s, computers started getting even smaller
- Real Game Changer -> PDAs or Personal Digital Assistants
- Allowed computing to go -> mobile
- Mobile Devices included -> Portable Media Players, Word Processors, Email Clients, Internet Browsers, etc. --> 1 handheld device
- Late 1990s, Nokia introduced PDA with Mobile Phone Functionality
- Ignited the industry -> Pocketable Computers or Smartphones
