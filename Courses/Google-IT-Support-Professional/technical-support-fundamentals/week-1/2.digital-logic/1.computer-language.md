title: Example

0+1=? - only takes a moment to come up with the answer

List of Questions:
- 0+0=?
- 0+1=?
- 1+0=?
- 1+1=?
if we needed to do 100 calculations this simple
we could do it and if we are careful, not make any mistakes
But, how abt a billion?
```

/\ This is exactly what a computer does. Compares [[1.computer-language#^36721c|1s and 0s]] --> millions and billions/per second


### More Info: Binary Systems

^eec9e4

- We group binary into 8 numbers/bits
- A bit is a binary digit
- Historically, we used 8 bits
	- Reason: In the early days of computing, hardware utilized the base-2 numeral system to move bits around
	- 2<sup>8</sup> numbers offered us a large enough range of values to do the computing we needed
	- Back then, any num. of bits were used
	- Eventually, the grouping of 8 bits became the industry standard that we use today
- A group of 8 bits --> A byte
	- Eg: 01100011
- Each byte can store 1 character, and we can have 256 possible values because of the base-2 system (2<sup>8</sup>)
