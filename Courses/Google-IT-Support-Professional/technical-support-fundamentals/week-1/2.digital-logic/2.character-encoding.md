# Character Encoding

^4cbc6b

- There are only 256 possible values in the [[1.computer-language#^36721c|binary system]]
- We can represent all of the things we see on our screens from only these 256 possible values, thanks to Character Encoding

## Word Meanings
- Character Encoding = Assigns binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them. [[2.character-encoding#^4cbc6b|More Info here]]

### More about Character Encoding
- It's like a dictionary
- Way for our computers to look up which human characters should be represented by a given binary value
- Oldest Character Encoding Standard --> ASCII
- Other character encoding standards recreated to represent different languages, different amounts of characters and more
	- Eventually they would require more than 256 values we were allowed to have
- Came UTF-8 [[2.character-encoding#^e14349|More Info here]]
- Unicode Standard helps us represent character encoding in a consistent manner


#### More About ASCII
- Oldest Character Encoding Standard
- ASCII --> Represents the English Alphabet, digits and punctuation marks
	- 1st character in ASCII to Binary table -> lowercase a -> maps to 01100001 in binary
- Advantage: Only used 127 values out of possible 256 
- Lasted for a very long time, (But wasn't enough)


#### More about UTF-8

^e14349

- Most prevalent encoding standard used today
- Has the same ASCII table, lets us use a var. no. of bytes
	- Eg: It's not possible to make emojis with a single byte, since we can only store one character in a byte
	- Instead, UTF-8 allows us to store a character in more than 1 byte --> endless emoji fun
- Built off the Unicode standard

### How do we represent colour?
- There are all kinds of colour models
- Basic -> used in a lot of computers --> RGB Model (Red, Green, Blue)
- We use 3 characters for the RGB Model
- Each character represents a shade of the color 
	- That then changes the color of the pixel you see on your screen
- With just 8 combinations of 0s and 1s, we are able to represent everything that we see on our computers
