x# Binary
We already know what [[1.computer-language#^36721c|Binary system]] is
Some info has been discussed [[1.computer-language#^eec9e4|here]] too

## Word Meanings
Logic Gates: Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions. [[Supplement-Logic Gates|More Info]]

### How do our computers get these 0s and 1s?
```ad-note
title: Theory of Imagination
collapse: open
We have -->
- light bulb 
- switch that turns the state of light on/off. 

if light --> on, State -> 1
if light --> off, State -> 0
```
```ad-note
title: Imagination
collapse:close
8 light bulbs and switches --> represent 8 bits -> state of 0 and 1
Eg: 01101010
```
```ad-important

Backtrack --> punch cards used in Jacquard's Programmable Loom
if hole -> hook thread --> on
if no-hole -> no hook thread --> off
```
```ad-attention
collapse:open
By just translating the combination of 0s and 1s
computer could calculate any possible amount of numbers
```
today, Binary -> electricity via transistors
[[2.path-to-modern-computers#^8d922a|Transistors]] --> allowing electrical signals to pass through

if electric voltage -> 1
if no -> 0

Just having transistors isn't enough for complex tasks

```ad-note
title:Imagination for Logic Gates
collapse:close
2 light switches -> opposite ends of room
each controlling a light

what if-
turn on light -> 1 switch
other switch wouldn't turn off

Poorly designed room
