# Abstraction
Meaning: to take a complex system and simplify it for our use

When we interact with computers with our mouse, keyboard or other input devices, we don't tell it the actual 0s and 1s it needs to understand. We actually use abstraction in our day-to-day life without even knowing. 

Abstraction gives us a common interface for our use. We don't need to know how computers operate inside or what happens when we are clicking a mouse button or tapping a keyboard. We interact by using our mouse and keyboard without even worrying what is happening inside it. 

An Important example of how abstraction is being used in technology:
**An Error Message**
We don't need to find errors/bugs in someone else's code and find out what the problem is. It's already written out/*abstracted* in the form of an error message.
