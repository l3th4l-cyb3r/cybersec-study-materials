# We cannot start a variable name with a number
# if variable contains more than 1 word, we should seperate them with "_" (underscore)

# Advantages of variables
# labeling data makes it easier to tell what the value represents
# allow you to use the same data repeatedly
# when we want to change the value of the variable, we only need to change it once
