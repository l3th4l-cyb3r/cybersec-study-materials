As new versions of Windows are introduced, older versions are deprecated and no longer receive Microsoft updates (unless a long-term support contract is purchased in some cases).

Windows Server 2008 and 2012 
- reached end of life for security updates on January 14,2020

Currently, only server 2012 R2 and later are in support

However, Microsoft has released out-of-band patches for earlier versions of Windows in the past few years due to the discovery of the critical SMBv1 vulnerability (EternalBlue).

Many versions of Windows are now deemed legacy and are no longer supported

Organizations often find themselves running various older operating systems to support critical applications or due to operational or budgetary concerns.

An assessor needs to understand the differences between versions and the various misconfigurations and vulnerabilities inherent to each.

We can use the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to find information about the operating system. This cmdlet can be used to get instances of WMI classes or information about available WMI classes. There are a variety of ways to find the version and build number of our system. We can easily obtain this information using the win32_OperatingSystem class, which shows that we are on a Windows 10 host, build number 18362.   

Some other useful classes that can be used with Get-WmiObject are Win32_Process to get a process listing, Win32_Service to get a listing of services Win32_Bios to get BIOS information. We can use the ComputerName parameter to get information about remote computers. GetWmiObject can be used to start and stop services on local and remote computers, and more. Further information about the cmdlet can be found here and here.

Obtain **Version** and **BuildNumber**

Get-WmiObject -Class win32_OperatingSystem | select Version,BuildNumber
