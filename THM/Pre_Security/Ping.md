# Ping
#### One of the most important fundamental network tools

- uses ICMP
	- ICMP = **I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol
- determines the performance of a connection between devices
	- Eg: if the connection exists or is reliable
- time taken for ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping
	- measuring is done using ICMP's echo packet 
	- ICMPs echo reply from target device
- can be performed against devices on a network
